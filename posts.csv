Semantics: HTML has a somewhat loose way of being interpreted by the browser. So your document could be visually cool, but still be a complete wreck structurally. For example, using the <div> tag with plain text in it would give the similitude of a <p> tag. You may ask," \""if it gets the job done"," why worry about all that?\"" I\'d tell you... it makes your document (since it is indeed meant to be a document) more logical and accessible by screen readers. Trust me", you don\'t want a lawsuit like [this one](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/beyonces-parkwood-entertainment-sued-1172909). It also helps your Search Engine Optimization (SEO). [Read more about semantics](https://www.lifewire.com/why-use-semantic-html-3468271)\n2.  Specificity: It\'s good to use classes and ID\'s when creating your html document, it\'s better to use them intelligently. Using ID names that will clearly define the section it is being used for will help your document structure. For example," using an ID \""header-section\"" for the introductory section of the document is quite better than using \""num1\"". Also"

At the time, I was still fumbling around with getting lucid and blogger right! It was a humbling experience. However, I was able to get this done but I was already behind far schedule.\n\n### HTML\n\nI finally got down to writing the HTML. HTML is Hypertext Markup Language.

Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page\'s appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).\n\nIt refers to links that connect web pages to one another", either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people," you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.\""\n\nI wrote the HTML code", followed the hint of the mentors and used table to style the content. Admittedly," the table has been a saviour. Without it my \""website\"" would have been Hiroshima after the bomb!\n\nI used border attribute to structure the table because the instruction was to use no CSS.

(html) is an essential part of website development.\n\n**_Basically Html +CSS = website_**_._\n\nHtml makes up the basics structure of a webpage and its makes specially programming tools in its execution. This includes elements, tags, attributes etc. All this tools work and in hand e.g an element (heading or paragraph) must be accompanied by a opening and closing tag (<, >)\n\n**Elements:**¬†common elements include heading and paragraph. Their are symbolized with d h and p respectively. Headings range from h1 to h6.\n\n**Tag**: tags are used to give an element meaning when writing codes. Meaning an element MUST have an opening an a closing tag e.g a heading will appear <h> and </h> for opening and closing tags respectively while a paragraph will also be written in similar forms.\n\nI have learnt several other ways of using the html and i am gradually mastering the tool( one step at a time though time as not been friendly). Here is a sample of my work, its just a simple aspect and still in progress. I will show you as it grows.\n\n  \n\n![](/storage/1886/images/img-469h8orn9x.png)', NULL, 'html-short-practice-d5d', '2019-08-26 10:20:26'

And sometimes skip important lessons.\n\nThere were some questions asked by different mentors in the groups in the form of games in which getting it right earns you a reward. That is a plus. Those that don\'t get the answer fast enough or don\'t answer at all pick up one or two things from what others have dropped.

The pictures were scraped from the hotel websites.\n\nIn October 2012 I moved to Nigeria to try to build a business out of this hotel booking website. I landed, rented a flat in calabar and convinced a friend of mine, Charles, to join the project. I and Charles hit the streets of Calabar and started snapping photos of the hotels in Calabar. Soon we had the largest online list of hotels in Calabar. But none were yet bookable.\n\nWe coded a booking form one day and bought a company phone. We turned on the booking form and put the phone number on the site. We received 20 bookings for hotels in various parts of Nigeria that day, and had 100 missed calls on the phone. We could not book the hotels yet and we barely had time to address all the queries we received, so we took the number back off. We kept the booking form, but nothing would happen when people booked.\n\nSome time later, Jason Njoku wrote me a message on Facebook that he was starting an investment company called Spark and that he wanted to invest in Hotels.ng.

It makes it possible to define the style of each table and each block of text within a page\'s HTML", styles that are used more often than usual are defined only once ¬†in a CSS document.\n\n  \n\nCSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. For example, a Web developer may want to change the default h1 tag by adding some color to it, from a colour black to a color green for over twenty pages of a Web site. If the pages all point to the same style sheet, the colour only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the color green.\n\n  \n\nWhile CSS is great for creating text styles, it is helpful for formatting other aspects of Web page layout as well. For example, CSS can be used to define the padding, margin and border around images or text or other object.. CSS gives Web developers more exact control over how Web pages will look than HTML does.
